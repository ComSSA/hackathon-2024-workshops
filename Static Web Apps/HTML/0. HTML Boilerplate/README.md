# 0. HTML Boilerplate

## Overview

This sub-directory contains a **minimal HTML5 boilerplate** that includes the essential structure needed for a valid HTML document. The code provided serves as the foundation for any basic web page and includes the necessary elements for rendering a web page correctly across modern browsers.

## What You Will Learn

In this sub-directory, you'll find a simple HTML file with the following key components:

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Specifies the document type as HTML5, ensuring the page is rendered in standards mode.
2. **`<html lang="en">`**: The root element that wraps all content, with the `lang="en"` attribute specifying that the document's content is in English.
3. **`<head>`**: Contains metadata about the document, including:
   - **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**: Ensures proper character encoding.
   - **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**: Makes the page responsive on mobile devices.
   - **`<title>`**: Specifies the title of the page shown in the browser tab.
4. **`<body>`**: Contains the visible content of the page, which includes a heading (`<h1>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`).

## Purpose

This boilerplate is designed to be a starting point for any web page. It provides the basic structure that every HTML document should have, including proper meta tags for character encoding and responsive design. From here, you can build out more complex pages by adding additional content, styles, and functionality.

By understanding this basic structure, you can begin creating your own web projects with a solid foundation.
